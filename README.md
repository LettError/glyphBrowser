# GlyphBrowser

A sketch for a RoboFont extension for browsing and selecting unicode values, glyphnames, categories, lists. The name list is generated by the glyphNameFormatter project (See elsewhere). Work on GlyphNameFormatter is still in progress so things may change.

The name list contains all names with unicode values from the AGD, but then usually with completed unicode ranges.

The Add Glyphs button has been replaced by a Add to Glyphpanel button that opens the UFO's glyph panel. So you have some more options for adding a new glyph, or just adding it to the template. Warning: glyphs that are added to the template lose their unicode value on save. This is under consideration.

## To do:

  * Better preview of the glyphs in the list
  * Better typography for the column of hex values
  * Maybe report in the list if a glyph is present in the current font?
