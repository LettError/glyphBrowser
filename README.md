A RoboFont extension for browsing and selecting unicode values, glyphnames, categories, lists. The name list is generated by the [glyphNameFormatter](https://github.com/LettError/glyphNameFormatter) project. Work on GlyphNameFormatter is in continuous so things may change.

* Add selected names to the currently open font.
* Look up individual characters.
* Paste Unicode text and extract a character list.
* Drag & drop UFO, otf or ttf to the main names list and their unicode values will be used to select names.
* Shows Unicode categories for more characters
